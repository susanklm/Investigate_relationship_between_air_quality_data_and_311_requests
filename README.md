# Investigate relationship between air quality data and 311 requests.

__Overview :__ 
LA's air quality is not the best. We know that 311 requests consist of several categories, which are: 'Bulky Items', 'Metal/Household Appliances', 'Graffiti Removal',
'Homeless Encampment', 'Electronic Waste', 'Illegal Dumping Pickup', 'Multiple Streetlight Issue', 'Single Streetlight Issue', 'Dead Animal Removal', and 'Feedback'.
All of these requests, except 'Feedback', probably can affect the air quality becasuse in order to take care of a bulky item for example, the person who does the 311 service need to drive a car to the request location to remove the bulky item. We wonder if these services happens many times in a particaular area, then it will affect the air quality. Therefore, here, we try to figure out if there is any relationship between air quality and the different 311 requests.
